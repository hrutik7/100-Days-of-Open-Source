# 100 Days of Open Source (OSS) 

Hey there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm participating in the [#100DaysOfOSS](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/community/100-days-of-oss/) challenge with [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza/), starting from sept 24th, 2023. And this repo is where I'm keeping track of my 100 days of open source journey.

Feel free to join me and the community to explore the magical world of open source! ðŸ™Œ
